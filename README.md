  <h1>Simulation of DUM-E</h1>
</p>

In the project Dum-E, the simulation are done with the help of MATLAB and Simulink.
In this project, our robot Dum-E performs simple task of pick and place using a cad model Kinova Gen 3 Manipulator. <br>

The cad Model, [Kinova Gen 3](https://www.kinovarobotics.com/en/products/gen3-robot) is imported directly to be used in the simulation.

To perform the task, Environment is created to place shelves, balls and blocks for the robot so that pick and place task is performed.<br>
The final video for the simulation is in the Images and Video Folder. the simulations are then run to
