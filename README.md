  <h1>Simulation of DUM-E</h1>
</p>

In the project Dum-E, the simulation are done with the help of MATLAB and Simulink.

In this project, our robot Dum-E performs simple task of pick and place using a cad model Kinova Gen 3 Manipulator. <br>
The cad Model, [Kinova Gen 3](https://www.kinovarobotics.com/en/products/gen3-robot) is imported directly to be used in the simulation. To perform the task, Environment is<br>
created to place shelves, balls and blocks for the robot so that pick and place task is performed. The final video for <br> 
the simulation is in the Images and Video Folder.
